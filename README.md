# Data Analytics Internship Project – Codeceda

This repository contains the projects I completed during my **Data Analytics internship at Codeceda**. The projects cover tasks from Level 1 to Level 3, focusing on data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

## Project Overview

### Level 1 – Basic Data Analysis

**Dataset:** `iris.csv`
**Tasks:**

* **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, correcting data types, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions, relationships between features, and summarizing key statistics to understand the dataset.

### Level 2 – Intermediate Data Analysis

**Dataset:** `Stock Prices Data Set.csv`
**Tasks:**

* **Regression Analysis:** Predicting stock prices using linear regression models and evaluating performance.
* **Time Series Analysis:** Analyzing trends and patterns over time, visualizing stock price evolution, and performing moving average smoothing.

### Level 3 – Advanced Analysis

**Dataset:** `Sentiment dataset.csv`
**Task:**

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Sentiment Analysis:** Cleaning and preprocessing text data, applying NLP techniques to classify sentiment, and visualizing sentiment distribution.

## Tools & Technologies

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, nltk
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Outcome

This project demonstrates the complete workflow of a data analytics project: from data cleaning and visualization to predictive modeling and NLP analysis. Each task highlights practical techniques for extracting insights from real-world datasets.
